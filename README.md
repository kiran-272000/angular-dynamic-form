# DynamicForm

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 17.0.6.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Generates a reactive form dynamically.

I've designed a reusable template that dynamically generates a reactive form based on a provided JSON configuration. This configuration contains all the necessary details for creating form fields, including validations. This approach allows for the easy creation of forms with varying requirements simply by adjusting the JSON configuration.
